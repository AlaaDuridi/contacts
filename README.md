# React + Vite

### Simplicity of 'old school web'

```
 <Form> prevents the browser from sending the request to the server and sends it to your route action instead.

 after the action finishes, all of your useLoaderData hooks update and the UI stays in sync with your data automatically!
```

```
useNavigation returns the current navigation state: it can be one of "idle" | "submitting" | "loading".
```

```
avoid calling the loaders for unchanging routes (like the list) during a navigation.
```
